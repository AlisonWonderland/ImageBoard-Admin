# ImageBoard Admin

Content management app for ImageBoard. Lets admins manage content on ImageBoard, i.e delete comments or threads they deem inappropiate. As well as giving them the ability to add and remove admins if they have the permissions to do so through a UI.

It shares the same backend as ImageBoard: https://github.com/AlisonWonderland/ImageBoard/tree/master
